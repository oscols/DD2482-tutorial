### Simulate the Local Environment
First of all, we need to create an Ansible inventory file. This file is a configuration file that defines the hosts and groups of hosts (with their connection details) that Ansible manages and executes tasks on.

```
touch inventory.ini
```{{exec}}

Now, let's edit the inventory file to create a host group named missile_server, defined by `[missile_server]`. Within this group, weâ€™ll specify an individual host, `missile_server`, and set the connection type to `local`. This tells Ansible that all tasks should be executed on the local machine (localhost), rather than connecting to a remote server.

We will use the cat commande to write directly to the file.
```
cat <<EOF >> inventory.ini 
[missile_server]
missile_server ansible_connection=local
EOF
```{{exec}}


TEST
[ACCESS NGINX]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_80}})
